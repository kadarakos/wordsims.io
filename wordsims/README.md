# WordSims: Word Similarity Benchmark#

The goal of this project is to provide a simple tool to test your vectorial word representations on  word similarity/relatedness benchmarks. It is intended to be used as a command line tool, but I tried to write WordSim object and its methods to be reusable in other projects. It is a re-wrote of http://wordvectors.org/ .

### Benchmarks ###
The folder word-sim-data contains the most used word similarity/relatedness benchmarks in  space separated format:  
word1 word2 score  
word3 word4 score  
  
More information about the benchmarks can be found on http://wordvectors.org/

### Usage ###
For testing I included the embeddings from http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/ (turian25.txt)

```
python wordsims.py csv turian25.txt cos
```
- Format: The first positional argument is the format of the input
    - csv: See turian25.txt.
    - dict: {word1: [vector], word2: [vector], ...}
    - word2vec: trained word2vec model object from gensim
- Path: path to the file
- Similartiy Metric: similarity metric to use, note that the probabilistic measures report 'divergence' in which case a negative correlation is to be desired between the word vectors and the benchmark sets 
    - cos: Cosine similarity
    - jsd: Jensen-Shannon Divergence (for probability distributions)
    - jeffrey: Jeffrey's Divergence (for probability distributions)   

The output reports the p-value and the of the correlations (see below). You just need to add or remove files of the required format from the word-sim-data folder if you would like to test your models on different benchmarks.
